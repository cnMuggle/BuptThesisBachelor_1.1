  abstract = {We describe a study designed to assess a brain-computer interface
	(BCI), originally described by Farwell and Donchin [9] in 1988. The
	system utilizes the fact that the rare events in the oddball paradigm
	elicit the P300 component of the event-related potential (ERP). The
	BCI presents the user with a matrix of 6 by 6 cells, each containing
	one letter of the alphabet. The user focuses attention on the cell
	containing the letter to be communicated while the rows and the columns
	of the matrix are intensified. Each intensification is an event in
	the oddball sequence, the row and the column containing the attended
	cell are "rare" items and, therefore, only these events elicit a
	P300. The computer thus detects the transmitted character by determining
	which row and which column elicited the P300. We report an assessment,
	using a bootstrapping approach, which indicates that an off line
	version of the system can communicate at the rate of 7.8 characters
	a minute and achieve 80% accuracy. The system's performance in real
	time was also assessed. Our data indicate that a P300-based BCI is
	feasible and practical. However, these conclusions are based on tests
	using healthy individuals. },

  abstract = {Biomedical signal monitoring systems have been rapidly advanced with
	electronic and information technologies in recent years. However,
	most of the existing physiological signal monitoring systems can
	only record the signals without the capability of automatic analysis.
	In this paper, we proposed a novel brain-computer interface (BCI)
	system that can acquire and analyze electroencephalogram (EEG) signals
	in real-time to monitor human physiological as well as cognitive
	states, and, in turn, provide warning signals to the users when needed.
	The BCI system consists of a four-channel biosignal acquisition/amplification
	module, a wireless transmission module, a dual-core signal processing
	unit, and a host system for display and storage. The embedded dual-core
	processing system with multitask scheduling capability was proposed
	to acquire and process the input EEG signals in real time. In addition,
	the wireless transmission module, which eliminates the inconvenience
	of wiring, can be switched between radio frequency (RF) and Bluetooth
	according to the transmission distance. Finally, the real-time EEG-based
	drowsiness monitoring and warning algorithms were implemented and
	integrated into the system to close the loop of the BCI system. The
	practical online testing demonstrates the feasibility of using the
	proposed system with the ability of real-time processing, automatic
	analysis, and online warning feedback in real-world operation and

  abstract = {Over the past decade, many laboratories have begun to explore brain-computer
	interface (BCI) technology as a radically new communication option
	for those with neuromuscular impairments that prevent them from using
	conventional augmentative communication methods. BCI's provide these
	users with communication channels that do not depend on peripheral
	nerves and muscles. This article summarizes the first international
	meeting devoted to BCI research and development. Current BCI's use
	electroencephalographic (EEG) activity recorded at the scalp or single-unit
	activity recorded from within cortex to control cursor movement,
	select letters or icons, or operate a neuroprosthesis. The central
	element in each BCI is a translation algorithm that converts electrophysiological
	input from the user into output that controls external devices. BCI
	operation depends on effective interaction between two adaptive controllers,
	the user who encodes his or her commands in the electrophysiological
	input provided to the BCI, and the BCI which recognizes the commands
	contained in the input and expresses them in device control. Current
	BCI's have maximum information transfer rates of 5-25 b/min. Achievement
	of greater speed and accuracy depends on improvements in signal processing,
	translation algorithms, and user training. These improvements depend
	on increased interdisciplinary cooperation between neuroscientists,
	engineers, computer programmers, psychologists, and rehabilitation
	specialists, and on adoption and widespread application of objective
	methods for evaluating alternative methods. The practical use of
	BCI technology depends on the development of appropriate applications,
	identification of appropriate user groups, and careful attention
	to the needs and desires of individual users. BCI research and development
	will also benefit from greater emphasis on peer-reviewed publications,
	and from adoption of standard venues for presentations and discussion.},
